\title{Using VDMS to Index and Search 100M Images}
% I shortened the title because of spacing looked nice in first
% page and in some of the last pages.
% The abstract already explained what VDMS is, so it
% should be good.

% possible, but not really needed or used for PVLDB:

% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data scientists spend most of their time dealing with data preparation,
rather than doing what they know best:
build machine learning models and algorithms to solve previously unsolvable problems.
In this paper, we describe the Visual Data Management System (VDMS),
and demonstrate how it can be used to simplify the data preparation process
and consequently gain in efficiency simply because
we are using a system designed for the job.
To demonstrate this, we use one of the largest available
public datasets (YFCC100M),
with 99+ million images and videos, plus add-ons that include
machine-generated tags and 4K dimensional feature vectors,
for a total of $\sim$13TB of data.
VDMS differs from existing data management systems
due to its focus on supporting machine learning and
data analytics pipelines that rely on images, videos, and feature vectors,
treating these as first class citizens.
We demonstrate how VDMS outperforms well-known and widely used
systems for data management by up to $\sim$35x, with
an average improvement of about 15x for our use-cases, and particularly at scale.
At the same time, VDMS simplifies the process of data preparation and data access,
and provides functionalities non-existent in alternative options.

% \section{Final Thoughts on Good Layout}
% Please use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs. Avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).

% At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).

% Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
