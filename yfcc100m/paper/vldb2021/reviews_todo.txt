Previous Reviews: Main Points to address
========================================

* Better description and justification of why the components of VDMS
  provide a clear advantage, and justify design decisions.
  We need to clearly state WHY VDMS is better than baselines.

* Better explanation of the novelty: a Visual-centric API.

* Many questions on Persistent memory.
  Maybe consider remove this details altogether.

* More references? Use a16z architeture as reference.

* Better describe applications and importance of the general use of the
  pipeline we described. We need to mention that the use-case is real,
  and that the queries are exactly like our internal applications.
  (Done, maybe explain more on the Eval section?)

* Focus on image search use case, and avoid video/descriptors eval.
  (Done)

* Fix figures labels (change loc20 for geo)
  (Done)
