% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled.
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%
%   * Removed outdated text.

\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data scientists spend most of their time dealing with data preparation,
rather than doing what they know best:
build machine learning models and algorithms to solve problems.
The problem grows as the scale of the data used for analysis or training
grows. In this paper, we demonstrate how VDMS (the Visual Data Management System)
can be used to simplify the data preparation process and how we gain
in efficiency simply because we are using a system designed for the job.
To demonstrate this, we use one of the largest available
public datasets (YFCC100M),
with 99+ million images, 800+ thousand videos, plus add-ons that include
machine-generated tags and 4K dimensional feature vectors,
for a total of $\sim$13TB of data.
VDMS differs from existing large scale photo
serving, video streaming, and textual big-data management systems due to
its primary focus on supporting machine learning and
data analytics pipelines that use visual data
(images, videos, and feature vectors), treating these as first class citizens.
We demonstrate how VDMS outperforms well-known and widely used
systems for data management by up to $\sim$35x, with
an average improvement of about 15x for the queries we
used in our use-cases, and particularly at scale.
At the same time, VDMS simplifies the process of data preparation and data access,
and provides functionalities non-existent in alternative options.

\section*{Availability}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USENIX program committees give extra points to submissions that are
backed by artifacts that are publicly available. If you made your code
or data available, it's worth mentioning this fact in a dedicated
section.
